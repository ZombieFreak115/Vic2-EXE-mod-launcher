desc="LAND UNITS ONLY! This mod fixes a basegame oddity in which land brigades in a stack will reinforce less and less the bigger the stack is if you are below 100% supply, now they will all reinforce as if they were individual brigades"

#NOP's out the instruction which tells the game to  put the variable in for the next brigade in stack, effectively making all brigades act as if they are the 1st one
